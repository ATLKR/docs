# macOS Development Setup

This page will be guiding you through the Development Setup process, There will be many tutorials that will screw most of us without googling.
And I have been struggling to figure out how I could fix it without reinstalling, so you don't have to!

## Installing Package Management System

There's multiple Package Management System available for macOS; although it would be much harder for someone to use ALL of them at the same time as they often cause system to confuse certain binaries and they sometimes just wont work by themselves.

### (Home)brew

I'm pretty sure Homebrew would be the most famous Package Manager for macOS. It's easy to install and you just have to copy the curl script so it could pull up all the shell scripts that should be ran by itself.

#### Installing Homebrew

Please visit https://brew.sh/ for most recent install script.
